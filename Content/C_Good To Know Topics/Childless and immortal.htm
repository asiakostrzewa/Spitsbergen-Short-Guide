        <h2>Childless and immortal</h2>
        <h3>You cannot give birth or die on Svalbard</h3>
        <p>Women must fly to land a few weeks before childbirth (there is no labour Ward in the hospital), and you can stay on the island as long as you are able to take care of yourself. The average age does not exceed 40 years.
</p>
        <p>When the health of an island resident deteriorates significantly, the governor intervenes and firmly asks him to move to mainland Norway. Why?
</p>
        <p>Some time ago, bodies in the cemetery in Longyearbyen were found, they were preserved by permafrost and do not fully decompose. Research has shown that the collected samples contain, for example, the Spanish virus, which decimated the continent's population in 1918, also reaching Svalbard.
</p>
        <p>Significant global warming could therefore contribute to the outbreak of further epidemics. To prevent similar situations and protect residents, special precautions were taken and the cemetery was closed over 80 years ago, and a "dying ban" was introduced.
</p>
        <p>Even if it is too late to be transported to mainland Norway or an accident occurs, the body is sent back to the mainland according to the person's last place of residence. That's why it is said that you cannot die on this island.</p>
