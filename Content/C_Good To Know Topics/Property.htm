        <h3>Spitsbergen is not only Norwegian</h3>
        <p>Under the Spitsbergen Treaty, all signatories (currently 42 countries, including Poland) have equal rights in economic and scientific activities. This means they can hunt, fish, conduct marine, industrial, mining and commercial activities, and can also conduct scientific research, regulated by local regulations.

        <p>Svalbard is also a demilitarized zone.</p>
