        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h3>What you should know about Spitsbergen</h3>
        <p>Spitsbergen is the largest island in Norway, located in the Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic Sea.
This place means nothing else than sharp (spits) mountains (bergen).</p>
        <h3>The population of Longyearbyen is 2,077 people, including 44 nationalities!</h3>
        <p>The largest group apart from Norwegians are Thais (106). Then in order are Swedes (91), Russians (46), Danes (28), Germans (25), Croatians (15), Filipinos (12), Chileans (8). The remaining nations are represented by a single person.
Most people come here on several-year contracts. There are few "native" inhabitants.</p>
        <p>In the article below you will find useful information if you are planning a trip to Spitsbergen, far beyond the Arctic Circle.</p>
