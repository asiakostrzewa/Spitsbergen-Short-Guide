        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <h3>If a bear is shot on the island (there are over 3,000 of them), the governor starts an investigation</h3>
        <p>In such a case, it is checked each time whether shooting the bear could not have been avoided and whether a self-defense situation was necessary.
</p>
        <p>If, for example, an animal is shot from a distance of 130 meters, the governor will most likely decide that this is too long distance and impose a huge fine on the shooter. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="Note1"><b>Note</b>
            <br />Killing a bear is a last resort. First, you must use all other methods (whistle, flares, warning shots) and only in a situation of immediate threat to life, shoot the bear.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        <h3>To move around the island you must have a weapon or be with a guide who has a weapon</h3>
        <p>The situation does not concern Longyearbyen city itself, because bears usually do not approach the agglomeration, although they sometimes came dangerously close.
</p>
        <p>There is also a rule that you cannot bring weapons into any premises. Usually there are signs hanging on them informing that all the bears in the store/restaurant/premises are dead, so you are asked to leave your Mauser outside in a specially prepared hiding place.</p>
        <h3>In most public places you must take off your shoes when entering the building</h3>
        <p>This applies, among others, to the church, museum, tourist information, but also to hotels, private homes and offices.</p>
