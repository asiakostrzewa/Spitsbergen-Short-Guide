        <h2>Polar day and night</h2>
        <h3>The sun does not set here for almost 4 months and vice versa - it does not rise for a similar amount of time</h3>
        <p>From October 25 to March 8, residents have not a daylight. The polar night is probably the most difficult to survive in these already difficult conditions. What do locals usually in the winter?
</p>
        <p>They spend their times with books, good movies, lots of chocolate and... having sex.
</p>
        <p>During the polar night, children are sent to special UV exposure.
</p>
        <p>When the sun appears for the first time after a long break, residents gather at the steps of the old hospital to welcome it.</p>
