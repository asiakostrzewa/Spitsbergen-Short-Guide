        <h3>The houses and buildings in Longyearbyen are built on stilts</h3>
        <p>The ground freezes 500 meters deep and the inhabitants speak of the "permafrost" phenomenon. The only brick building is a white house, about 2 km from the center, where the famous "Huset" restaurant is located. For the same reason, sewage and electricity are outside - pipes and cables run along the streets.</p>
        <h3>Hytte means summer cottage</h3>
        <p>This type of construction is most popular among the residents of Longyearbyen.
</p>
        <p>The problem is that you cannot build new houses, and there are only few hyttes on the island. So, to become the owner of a hytte you need to spend approximately 1-2 million PLN.
</p>
        <p>Hytte can only be purchased by a resident of Svalbard.</p>
