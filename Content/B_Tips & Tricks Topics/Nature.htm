        <h3>Spitsbergen is sometimes called a "geological picture book"</h3>
        <p>This is because you can find fossils from all important geological periods here, and the fact that there are practically no trees at all makes it easier to search.</p>

        <h3>You cannot own a cat in Svalbard</h3>
        <p>Cats are a threat to the population of birds living in the archipelago.
</p>
        <p>However, from time to time you will find litter and food for these animals in local supermarket.</p>
        <h3>There are also no spiders</h3>
        <p>...and that's good news!</p>
