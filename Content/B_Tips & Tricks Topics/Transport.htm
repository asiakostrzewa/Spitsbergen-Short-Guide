        <h3>Toyota dominates the automotive market in Spitsbergen</h3>
        <p>Why? Supposedly because it can be started at -30 degrees without any problems, but the Mercedes cannot.</p>
        <h3>In Svalbard, cars have black registration plates with yellow letters ZN and numbers</h3>
        <p>Due to the fact that there are many Toyota cars and the registrations differ only by one digit, it happens that residents return home in a car that is not their own. But in the end, everyone finds their car - it cannot be stolen from the island.</p>
