        <h3>In Longyearbyen is the most northern brewery in the world</h3>
        <p>It has existed since 2011 and there was necessary to change Norwegian law to be able to produce it. The first beer was produced in 2015, and - for example - the goal for 2017 was to produce 250,000 liters of the golden drink.
</p>
        <p>You can taste Arctic beer in local restaurants. There are also organized trips during which you can try beers produced in the brewery.</p>
        <h3>The Huset restaurant has the world's largest wine collection</h3>
        <p>This is surprising because Spitsbergen is not associated with wine at all.
</p>
        <p>There? Really?
</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, since 1980, over 20,000 bottles of wine from all over the world have been collected here!</p>
