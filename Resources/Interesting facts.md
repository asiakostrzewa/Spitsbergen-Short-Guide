# Longyearbyen is home to the northernmost bank, church, supermarket, university...
This list can go on almost endlessly. 
At the turn of January and February, the northernmost jazz festival in the world takes place here - Polarjazz. Its motto is "Cold place - hot music".

# The Global Seed Bank is located on Spitsbergen
This place is nothing less than the last resort for our species if some disaster were to occur. 
The project was started to protect most of the plant species known on Earth from extinction. Currently, approximately 800,000 pieces of various materials are stored there. Due to the very low ambient temperature, seeds are stored without the use of electricity. 
Unfortunately, this place is inaccessible to the common man. When driving to or from the airport, all you can see is the entrance sticking out of the rock.

Childless and immortal
