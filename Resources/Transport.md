# The most popular type of transport are snowmobiles
There are almost 4,000 snowmobiles for just over 2,000 inhabitants. Cars start moving only when the roads are passable. 
There are only 40 km of roads on the island, only the main road is asphalt, outside the city there is gravel. 
The speed limit is 50 km/h. 30 km/h is in side streets and almost all intersections are equivalent. 
When it snows, a snowmobile is necessary in these conditions.
