# Streets don't have names, only numbers

# The houses and buildings in Longyearbyen are built on stilts
The ground freezes 500 meters deep and the inhabitants speak of the "permafrost" phenomenon. The only brick building is a white house, about 2 km from the center, where the famous "Huset" restaurant is located. For the same reason, sewage and electricity are outside - pipes and cables run along the streets.

# Hytte means summer cottage
This type of construction is most popular among the residents of Longyearbyen.
The problem is that you cannot build new houses, and there are only few hyttes on the island. So, to become the owner of a hytte you need to spend approximately 1-2 million PLN. 
Hytte can only be purchased by a resident of Svalbard.
