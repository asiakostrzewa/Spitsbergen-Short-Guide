# In Longyearbyen is the most northern brewery in the world
It has existed since 2011 and there was necessary to change Norwegian law to be able to produce it. The first beer was produced in 2015, and - for example - the goal for 2017 was to produce 250,000 liters of the golden drink. 
You can taste Arctic beer in local restaurants. There are also organized trips during which you can try beers produced in the brewery.

# The Huset restaurant has the world's largest wine collection
This is surprising because Spitsbergen is not associated with wine at all. 
There? Really? 
Meanwhile, since 1980, over 20,000 bottles of wine from all over the world have been collected here!
