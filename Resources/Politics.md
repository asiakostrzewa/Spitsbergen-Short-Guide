# Unemployment is 0%
That's because you can't stay here without a job. If this happens, the island's governor will make sure that you leave the archipelago as quickly and efficiently as possible, at your own expense, of course. Some of the jobs are seasonal, so no one is surprised that some people have 3-4 jobs. In most cases, knowledge of Norwegian is necessary.

# Spitsbergen is a duty-free zone
Each resident receives a personal alcohol card 6 months after registration in the place of residence on the island. The restrictions apply to vodka and beer: 2 bottles of alcohol above 21% and 24 cans of beer must be enough for a month. 
But no matter what, there are 21 places serving high-proof alcoholic beverages in the city.

# Income tax in Svalbard is 15%
Compared to 40% on mainland Norway, this seems very attractive. 
Unfortunately, higher prices of products, services and apartments mean that the money does not stay in the resident's pocket.

Who owns the islands? > Property
