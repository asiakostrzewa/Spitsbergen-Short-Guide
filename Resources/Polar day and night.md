# The sun does not set here for almost 4 months and vice versa - it does not rise for a similar amount of time
From October 25 to March 8, residents have not a daylight. The polar night is probably the most difficult to survive in these already difficult conditions. What do locals usually in the winter?
They spend their times with books, good movies, lots of chocolate and... having sex.
During the polar night, children are sent to special UV exposure. 
When the sun appears for the first time after a long break, residents gather at the steps of the old hospital to welcome it.
